  <div class='pipeTag text'>
    <p>
      Beneath the cracked and overgrown streets, a network of exposed pipes runs like veins through the town. As you
      approach the pipes, you notice that the liquid flowing through them is not the usual clear water, but instead, it
      has a peculiar, slightly tinted hue. The color is difficult to describe, not quite fitting into any familiar
      spectrum. This subtle difference in the liquid's appearance hints at something unusual lurking beneath the surface
      of the abandoned town, raising questions about the nature of the substance and its purpose.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class='constructionTag text'>
    <p>In the center of the main street, a large, hastily patched hole catches your eye. The repair work seems shoddy
      and out of place, as if done in a hurry without proper materials. As you step closer to inspect the patch, you
      feel a faint, almost imperceptible vibration emanating from beneath the surface. It's not a constant sensation,
      but rather an intermittent pulse, like a slow, irregular heartbeat. The feeling is unsettling, and you can't shake
      the idea that something beneath the street is not quite right, as if the ground itself is hiding a secret that
      threatens to break through the flimsy patch.</p>
  </div>
  <div class='carTag text'>
    <p>A lone, rusted car sits in an empty parking lot, its doors ajar and its windows shattered. The tires are
      extremely used, caked in several layers of old mud. Inside the car, you
      find a peculiar device resembling a compass, but instead of pointing north, its needle spins erratically.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class='dumpsterTag text'>
    <p>
      Behind a row of abandoned buildings, two dumpsters stand, their contents spilling onto the ground. Amidst the
      debris, you discover a torn page from an ancient scientific journal. The page contains diagrams and equations that
      hint at the existence of alternate dimensions and the possibility of inter-dimensional travel. The equations seem
      to be related to the strange energy permeating the town.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class='treeTag text'>
    <p>
      Beyond the partition gate lies a small plot of land, where twisted, gnarled trees grow in unnatural patterns. The
      trees seem to be connected by a network of luminescent roots that pulsate with the same energy as the substance in
      the pipes. At the center of the plot stands a ancient, weathered stone monolith covered in cryptic symbols,
      hinting at an inter-dimensional gateway.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class='cafeTag text'>
    <p>
      On the outskirts of the town, an abandoned cafe stands, its windows boarded up and its paint peeling. Inside, you
      find a peculiar mural covering an entire wall, depicting a vivid, otherworldly landscape filled with strange flora
      and fauna. The mural seems to be a glimpse into an alternate dimension, and upon closer inspection, you notice a
      faint outline of a doorway hidden within the painting.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class='plantTag text'>
    <p>
      Growing out of a crack in the sidewalk, a solitary, luminescent plant draws your attention. Its leaves shimmer
      with an iridescent glow, and as you approach, you notice a small, intricate key hanging from one of its branches.
      The key seems to resonate with the energy flowing through the town, and you instinctively know that it holds the
      power to unlock the inter-dimensional gateway.
